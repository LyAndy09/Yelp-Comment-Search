# Yelp Comment Searcher Project

## A work in progress, allows the user to search local business's comments for a specific phrase.

The project is a way of assessing a local business for a specific item and verifying the eexistence through its reviews.
For example, if I wanted to look for a "Lavender iced latte" local to me through yelp, there isn't a gaurantee that the results will have what i'm looking for.
Yelp will return a general search of coffee and will occasionally show a review highlighting the searched term.
